# light-tracker
> The program implements a light tracker with 2DOF (Degrees of Freedom). The circuit programs a stepper motor and servo motor. The stepper motor rotates the mechanism right and left along the azimuth while the servo motor rotates up and down along the altitude. The program uses two photoresistors and sets an algorithm to find the maximum light sensed while moving towards it.
